/**
 * This is an example of a Functional and stateless component (View) in React. Functional components are not classes and thus don't handle internal state changes.
 * Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
 * They are reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
 * Functional components have to return always something. However, they don't need a "render()" method.
