# SoPra FS24 - Client Template with build pack

## Getting started

Read and go through these Tutorials. It will make your life easier:)

- Read the React [Docs](https://react.dev/learn)
- Do this React [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) Tutorial (it doesn't assume any existing React knowledge)
- Get an Understanding of [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax), and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)!

Next, there are two other technologies that you should look at:

* [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/concepts) offers declarative routing for React. It is a collection of navigational components that fit nicely with the application. 
* [react-hooks](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-hooks-react-router/) let you access the router's state and perform navigation from inside your components.

## Prerequisites and Installation
For your local development environment, you will need Node.js.\
We urge you to install the exact version **v20.11.0** which comes with the npm package manager. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/).\
If you are confused about which download to choose, feel free to use these direct links:

- **MacOS:** [node-v20.11.0.pkg](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0.pkg)
- **Windows 32-bit:** [node-v20.11.0-x86.msi](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-x86.msi)
- **Windows 64-bit:** [node-v20.11.0-x64.msi](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-x64.msi)
- **Linux:** [node-v20.11.0.tar.xz](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64.tar.xz) (use this [installation guide](https://github.com/nodejs/help/wiki/Installation#how-to-install-nodejs-via-binary-archive-on-linux) if you are new to Linux)

If you happen to have a package manager the following commands can be used:

- **Homebrew:** `brew install node@20.11.0`
- **Chocolatey:** `choco install nodejs-lts --version=20.11.0`

After the installation, update the npm package manager to **10.4.0** by running ```npm install -g npm@10.4.0```\
You can ensure the correct version of node and npm by running ```node -v``` and ```npm --version```, which should give you **v20.11.0** and **10.4.0** respectively.\
Before you start your application for the first time, run this command to install all other dependencies, including React:

```npm install```

Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use a Chrome-based browser).\
The client will send HTTP requests to the server which can be found [here](https://github.com/HASEL-UZH/sopra-fs24-template-server).\
In order for these requests to work, you need to install and start the server as well.

### Testing
Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`\
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance:\
The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
